# BovReg-Reproducibility

This repository aims to be a template to develop reproducible pipelines for BovReg partners involved in bioinformatics analysis.

The repository contains a notebook bla blab

We used as example a demo to quantify transcript expression using RNA-seq data. This demo is adopted from this [repository](https://github.com/nextflow-io/rnaseq-nf)


## Software

All the software that is needed to run the demo pipeline can be found as a docker container or as a conda environment

### Docker container

All the software tools used on the pipeline are available in a [Docker](http://www.docker.com) image on DockerHub [here](https://hub.docker.com/r/cbcrg/regressive-msa/) and the image is tested to be compatible with the [Singularity](http://singularity.lbl.gov/). You can follow this Dockerfile to create your container
